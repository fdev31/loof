How to make them different
    Possible options I see:
    
    - Secondary color (circle around ? dot in center ? "head" color ?)
    - Text (sounds boring, but very flexible)
    - Shapes
        - could be combined ?

Any kind of level could be shown, rounded or so
It may require improvements to the level description format

=========================================

:bugid: 3
:created: 2017-04-11T19:35:44

When shooting or bouncing near the limits the ball can escape

If it cannot be avoided, some code could re-initialize the ball if it goes far
